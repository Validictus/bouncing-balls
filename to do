bugs:
  fix inter-object collision bugs

ideas:
  1) hp-counter display in the middle of each circle decrementing on impact -- spliced at 0 (easy)
  2) hp-counter that decreases circle size upon impact, possibly based on aggregate speed (hard)
  3) roaming shader circles changing color based on which has the most circles inside (hard)
  4) instead of flipping velocity aggregate velocity then distribute 90:10 to create pseudo-innertia
